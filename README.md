# Free for use Somali Dictionary
 
Here we are preparing projects to promote Somali
> it is a free and volunteer project (nonprofit)

# [SOMALI DICTIONARY](https://github.com/yahyaqowle/Afsoomali/tree/main/Somali-Dictionary)
Step 1. This dictionary of the Somali language will contain 969 pages and we will take it from a book written by Annarita Puglielli, Abdalla Omar Mansoor about the dictionary of the Somali language. (This Somali Dictionary will consist of 969 pages that is written by Annarita Puglielli, Abdalla Omar Mansur. our source will be this Somali Dictionary.pdf).

Step 1.1 Extracting = We extract Words and their meanings From the pdf file into the Somali Dictionary.txt (Starting from A to Z orderly). Example: after we finish writing A words then we go B and C and so on.

Step 1.2 Categorising = After we done Step 1.1 then we go to next face called categorising. we categorise the text that we extracted in step 1 and put in a folder called Alphabets(alifbeeto). example: in step 1.1 we extracted A words from the pdf and we organise and saved in Somali-Dictionary.txt, now in step 1.2 we are copying only the A words from Somali-Dictionary and creating new text file and save it A.txt in the Alphabet folder. we repeat this method
(categorising) to every alphabet.

# [SOMALI WORDS](https://github.com/yahyaqowle/Afsoomali/tree/main/Somali-words)

Step 2. We are preparing a file in different formats such as .txt and .csv for words that we have extracted from the dictionary and the purpose is to prepare dry words.
(We are extracting Vocabulary words from Dictionary that we write and we will change to different formats).

Step 2.1 We will do the same as Step 1.1 but instead of copying from the pdf we will use python(it's a simple method).
Step 2.2 Categorising = we will imply like Step 1.2.
